## Self-assessment

The test required the use of five libraries: React JS, Redux, Google Recaptcha, React Router, and React Material UI. To be honest, I am just familiar with ReactJS and React Router. I have some knowledge of the remaining three libraries, but I haven’t used them in my own projects. Despite this, I tried my best to complete the test as well as possible.

### What I've finished:

- Designed the entire user interface using React Material UI
- Implemented page navigation using React Router
- Integrated Google Recaptcha
- Handled logic and component division.

### What I will need to do or refactor:

- Due to the three-day deadline and my current understanding of Redux, I did not utilize it in this test. However, I plan to learn more about Redux and apply it to my own projects after this test.
- I noticed that some components have not been split yet. My initial focus was on problem-solving, and after that, I plan to refactor and break down some of the code into components such as forms, selects, etc.
- Near the completion of the user interface, I discovered that MUI has a styles system. The absence of a styles system in MUI was quite challenging for me.
