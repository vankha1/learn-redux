# Survey form 

### What I've finished:

- Designed the entire user interface using React Material UI
- Implemented page navigation using React Router
- Integrated Google Recaptcha
- Handled logic and component division.
- Implemented user information with Redux-toolkit

### What I will need to do or refactor:

- I noticed that some components have not been split yet. My initial focus was on problem-solving, and after that, I plan to refactor and break down some of the code into components such as forms, selects, etc.
- Near the completion of the user interface, I discovered that MUI has a styles system. The absence of a styles system in MUI was quite challenging for me.
